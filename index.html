    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      Software Developer mastering the modern web stack. Leveraging a C++/C#
      background to build with HTML, CSS, JS, and React. I am a developer with a
      passion for logic and problem-solving, focused on building digital
      experiences that are not only functional and efficient but also intuitive
      and user-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      My background in robust, object-oriented languages like C++ and C# has
      provided me with a strong foundation in software engineering principles,
      data structures, and the importance of clean, scalable code. I am now
      channeling that discipline and structured thinking to master the modern
      web development ecosystem. I see the transition to HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript not as a change, but as an expansion: the opportunity to apply
      the same technical rigor to create dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      What drives me most is the full lifecycle of creation: from conceiving an
      idea to its final implementation, polishing every detail along the way. I
      am committed to continuous learning and eager to contribute to challenging
      projects where I can apply my skills and grow alongside a talented team.
      My goal is clear: to become a high-impact Full-Stack developer, and
      mastering the Frontend is my first strategic step on that path.
